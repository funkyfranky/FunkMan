# FunkMan
 Discord bot interface for Moose.

## Subpackages
FunkMan contains three subpackages:
- `FunkSock`: A socket server that handles data received via an UDP connection
- `FunkBot`: An interface to Discord bots using discord.py.
- `FunkPlot`: Contains a class to make pretty figures for the `MOOSE` `RANGE` and `AIRBOSS`classes using matplotlib.

You can use each of these subpackges on its own or in combination with the `FunkMan` package.
